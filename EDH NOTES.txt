Quite custom build - sourced from 1.2, but massively changed.


add paths for new programs into:
vendor/profile.ps1 for powershell
vendor/init.bat for cmd
vendor/github-for-windows/etc/bash_profile for git


This line in ConEmu.xml config breaks Far.exe left click:
see: https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/334#event-419601706
<!-- EVIL LINE; BREAKS FAR.EXE				<value name="WndDragKey" type="dword" data="80808001"/>		-->

Try to maintain portability. I BELIEVE all customizations to be in: (but don't count on it)
	!! also remember that user settings are in HOME DIRECTORY
vendor/profile.ps1
vendor/init.bat
config/
bin/
github's bin additions
scripts/helpfile
vendor/irssi
!!!!	vendor/github-for-windows/cmd/start-ssh-agent.bat
------------> I rewrote this and it is important!!!!!

(put the conemu plugins into farmanager)
