## Getting Started

To run Yeoman you will need to [install node](https://nodejs.org) for your platform. The setup will also install the [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) (npm) which you use to download Yeoman, generators, and many other software packages.

It is recommended that you install Yeoman and generators globally using  the `npm -g` switch so that you can run the generator from any folder.

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-code
```

Make a new directory and then cd into it.

```bash
mkdir myApp && cd $_
```

Run the Code generator:
```bash
yo code
```
